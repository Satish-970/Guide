                <h2>Introduction — Why Networking Is Foundational</h2>
                <p class="muted">Networking is how computers talk. From a single HTTP request to a global distributed
                    database replication, networks transport data reliably, quickly, and securely. For software
                    engineers, clear networking understanding helps you design scalable systems, debug production
                    issues, and answer placement interviews with confidence.</p>
                <p class="muted">This guide blends conceptual clarity with real-world patterns used by companies in
                    production — plus interview problems that companies ask.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="real" class="panel">
                <h2>Real-World Examples & Architecture Patterns</h2>
                <p class="muted">Real systems combine many networking components. Below are common patterns with
                    concrete examples.</p>

                <h3>Web Service (typical)</h3>
                <p class="muted">Client → CDN → Load Balancer → Fleet of App Servers → Database. Each arrow is a network
                    hop: CDN at edge reduces latency and bandwidth; load balancer distributes connections; backend
                    services talk over internal network/VPC to databases and caches.</p>

                <h3>Microservices + Service Mesh</h3>
                <p class="muted">Service-to-service communication is often over HTTP/2 or gRPC. A service mesh (e.g.,
                    Istio, Linkerd) handles mTLS, retries, circuit breaking, and observability at the network layer,
                    decoupling concerns from application code.</p>

                <h3>Real-time Streaming</h3>
                <p class="muted">Systems like Kafka and WebSocket services rely on long-lived TCP connections and
                    careful backpressure handling. Ingest nodes receive high QPS and often use partitioning +
                    replication to scale.</p>

                <h3>CDN & Edge Caching</h3>
                <p class="muted">Companies use CDNs (Cloudflare, Akamai) to cache static assets close to users. Dynamic
                    personalization is handled by edge logic + origin fetches.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="layers" class="panel">
                <h2>OSI vs TCP/IP — Layered Thinking</h2>
                <p class="muted">Layers help you reason: each layer provides services to the layer above and uses
                    services from the layer below.</p>
                <ol class="muted bullets">
                    <li><strong>Layer 1 — Physical:</strong> Bits on wire, cables, Ethernet PHY, fiber.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 2 — Data Link:</strong> MAC addresses, switches, Ethernet frames, ARP, VLANs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 3 — Network:</strong> IP addresses, routing, fragmentation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 4 — Transport:</strong> TCP (reliable), UDP (unreliable).</li>
                    <li><strong>Layer 5-7 — Session/Presentation/Application:</strong> TLS, HTTP, DNS, SMTP, application
                        protocols.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="muted">Think: if a ping fails, start bottom-up — physical/cable, link/switch, IP, transport,
                    then app layer.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="physical" class="panel">
                <h2>Physical & Data Link — Ethernet, Wi‑Fi, Frames</h2>

                <h3>Ethernet Basics</h3>
                <p class="muted">Ethernet frames wrap IP packets. Key fields: destination MAC, source MAC, EtherType,
                    payload, FCS (CRC). Standard speeds: 1Gbps, 10Gbps, 40/100Gbps in data centers.</p>

                <h3>Wireless (Wi‑Fi)</h3>
                <p class="muted">Wi‑Fi adds variable latency, interference, and lower reliability. Protocols
                    (802.11ac/ax) support MIMO, channel bonding. Important for mobile services and capacity planning.
                </p>

                <h3>ARP — Address Resolution Protocol</h3>
                <pre class="code" id="code-arp">
-- ARP example (conceptual)
Host A wants IP 10.0.0.5 -> sends ARP broadcast "Who has 10.0.0.5?"
Host B replies with MAC -> A caches mapping
</pre>

                <p class="muted">ARP poisoning is a common attack vector — use static ARP entries only where appropriate
                    and use secure network controls.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="mac-switch" class="panel">
                <h2>Switching, MAC Tables & VLANs</h2>
                <p class="muted">Layer 2 switches learn MAC addresses and forward frames to correct ports. VLANs
                    partition broadcast domains using 802.1Q tags — common for separating production, management, and
                    tenant networks.</p>

                <h3>Switching Table Example</h3>
                <p class="muted">When a switch learns that MAC X is on port 3, it records it and forwards frames to that
                    port — avoids flooding.</p>

                <h3>Trunking & Access Ports</h3>
                <p class="muted">Trunk ports carry multiple VLANs between switches; access ports belong to a single VLAN
                    for endpoint hosts.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="ip" class="panel">
                <h2>IP Addressing & Subnetting — IPv4 & IPv6 (Placement Essentials)</h2>
                <p class="muted">IP is the layer-3 addressing scheme. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1);
                    IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses for scalability.</p>

                <h3>Subnetting (IPv4) — Example</h3>
                <p class="muted">CIDR notation: 192.168.10.0/24 means IPs from 192.168.10.0 to 192.168.10.255 (256
                    addresses, usable host count 254).</p>
                <pre class="code" id="code-subnet">
-- Example: split 192.168.10.0/24 into two /25 subnets
192.168.10.0/25  -> 192.168.10.0 - 192.168.10.127
192.168.10.128/25 -> 192.168.10.128 - 192.168.10.255
</pre>

                <h3>Subnetting Trick (Placement tip)</h3>
                <p class="muted">To find host count: hosts = 2^(32 - prefix) - 2 (exclude network & broadcast for IPv4).
                    For quick mental math: /24=254, /26=62, /27=30.</p>

                <h3>IPv6 Basics</h3>
                <p class="muted">Compressed notation (2001:db8::1). No broadcast—uses multicast. Auto-configuration via
                    SLAAC and DHCPv6.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="routing" class="panel">
                <h2>Routing — Static, OSPF, BGP & How the Internet Forwards</h2>

                <h3>Static Routing</h3>
                <p class="muted">Manual route entries for small networks. Simple but not scalable.</p>

                <h3>Interior Gateway Protocols — OSPF</h3>
                <p class="muted">OSPF is link-state: routers share topology, compute shortest paths via Dijkstra. Good
                    for intra-AS routing with fast convergence.</p>

                <h3>Exterior Gateway Protocol — BGP</h3>
                <p class="muted">BGP advertises prefixes between autonomous systems (AS). It's path-vector-based and
                    policy-driven (not shortest-path). BGP handles route selection by policy, AS_PATH, local_pref, MED,
                    and communities.</p>

                <h3>BGP Practical Example</h3>
                <p class="muted">A multi-homed organization advertises its IP prefixes to two ISPs. Use local_pref to
                    prefer one ISP for outbound traffic and AS_PATH prepending to influence inbound paths.</p>

                <pre class="code" id="code-bgp">
# BGP concept snippet (not real config)
neighbor 203.0.113.1 remote-as 65001
network 198.51.100.0/24
set local-preference 200 for routes received from ISP-A to prefer them
</pre>

                <p class="muted">BGP safety: route filtering, max-prefix limits, TTL/security and RPKI origin validation
                    to avoid hijacks.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="transport" class="panel">
                <h2>Transport Layer — TCP vs UDP, 3‑way Handshake, Congestion Control</h2>

                <h3>TCP — Reliable, Ordered Stream</h3>
                <p class="muted">TCP provides reliable, in-order delivery with flow control and congestion control. Key
                    fields: sequence number, ack number, flags (SYN, ACK, FIN), window size.</p>

                <h3>Three-Way Handshake</h3>
                <pre class="code" id="code-3whs">
Client -> Server: SYN (seq=x)
Server -> Client: SYN-ACK (seq=y, ack=x+1)
Client -> Server: ACK (ack=y+1)
Connection established
</pre>

                <h3>Connection Teardown</h3>
                <p class="muted">FIN/ACK exchange; TIME_WAIT state prevents delayed segments from conflicting with new
                    connections.</p>

                <h3>Congestion Control (TCP Reno/CUBIC)</h3>
                <p class="muted">TCP increases congestion window (cwnd) by additive-increase, multiplicative-decrease on
                    loss. Modern Linux uses CUBIC for better performance on high-bandwidth links.</p>

                <h3>UDP — Lightweight, Best Effort</h3>
                <p class="muted">Use UDP for low-latency apps (DNS, VoIP, gaming) or when the app implements its own
                    reliability (QUIC builds on UDP).</p>
            </section>

            <section id="app" class="panel">
                <h2>Application Layer — HTTP, DNS, TLS, SMTP, gRPC</h2>

                <h3>HTTP & HTTPS</h3>
                <p class="muted">HTTP is stateless and text-based (HTTP/1.1). HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (QUIC) improve
                    multiplexing and reduce head-of-line blocking. HTTPS = HTTP over TLS for encryption and server
                    authentication.</p>

                <h3>DNS — The Internet Phonebook</h3>
                <p class="muted">DNS resolves names to records: A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), CNAME (alias), MX (mail), TXT
                    (SPF/DMARC). Authoritative servers answer for zones; recursive resolvers cache results for speed.
                </p>

                <h3>TLS Basics</h3>
                <p class="muted">TLS handshake negotiates cipher suite and establishes shared keys via public-key
                    cryptography. Use TLS 1.3 where possible (faster handshakes, improved security).</p>

                <h3>Example: DNS over HTTPS (DoH)</h3>
                <p class="muted">Privacy-aware resolvers use DoH or DoT (DNS over TLS) to encrypt DNS queries to
                    resolvers.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="nat-vpn" class="panel">
                <h2>NAT, DHCP, VPNs & Cloud Networking</h2>

                <h3>NAT — Network Address Translation</h3>
                <p class="muted">NAT maps private addresses to a public IP for Internet access. Port Address Translation
                    (PAT) multiplexes many private hosts through one public IP using port numbers.</p>

                <h3>DHCP — Dynamic Host Configuration</h3>
                <p class="muted">DHCP assigns IP addresses and network configuration (gateway, DNS) dynamically. Use
                    reservations for predictable endpoint addressing.</p>

                <h3>VPN — Secure Private Connectivity</h3>
                <p class="muted">VPNs (IPsec, OpenVPN, WireGuard) create encrypted tunnels between networks or
                    endpoints. WireGuard is modern and lightweight with simpler key management.</p>

                <h3>Cloud VPC Patterns</h3>
                <p class="muted">Cloud providers offer Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) with subnets, route tables, security
                    groups (firewall-like), and NAT gateways. Architect with private subnets for databases and public
                    subnets only for frontends.</p>

                <h2>Load Balancers, CDNs & Caching Strategies</h2>

                <h3>Load Balancers</h3>
                <p class="muted">Layer 4 (TCP) vs Layer 7 (HTTP) load balancers. L7 can do content-based routing, sticky
                    sessions, and TLS termination. Use health checks to route around unhealthy instances.</p>

                <h3>CDNs & Edge</h3>
                <p class="muted">CDNs cache content at edge PoPs. Cache-control headers control freshness. CDNs reduce
                    origin load, lower latency, and mitigate DDoS to some degree.</p>

                <h3>Caching Patterns</h3>
                <ul class="muted bullets">
                    <li>Cache-aside: application populates cache on miss.</li>
                    <li>Read-through: cache handles loading and writes through to DB.</li>
                    <li>Write-through: writes go to cache then storage (simplifies consistency).</li>

                <h2>Security: Firewalls, TLS, DDoS & Practical Hardening</h2>
                <p class="muted">Security spans multiple layers: network ACLs, host firewalls, application
                    authentication, and encryption.</p>

                <h3>Firewalls & ACLs</h3>
                <p class="muted">Stateful firewalls track connections and allow return traffic. Network ACLs (stateless)
                    filter based on IP/port rules. Use least-privilege rules and avoid wide open security groups.</p>

                <h3>DDoS Mitigation</h3>
                <p class="muted">Mitigation combines edge filtering (CDN/WAF), autoscaling, rate limiting, and upstream
                    scrubbing services. Plan for capacity and failover.</p>

                <h3>TLS Practical Tips</h3>
                <ul class="muted bullets">
                    <li>Use strong cipher suites and TLS 1.2+ (prefer 1.3).</li>
                    <li>Enable certificate rotation and automated renewal (Let's Encrypt or managed CA).</li>
                    <li>HSTS to prevent downgrade attacks for web services.</li>

                <h2>Troubleshooting: Tools & Techniques</h2>
                <p class="muted">When networks misbehave, use methodical steps to isolate the layer and component
                    causing issues.</p>

                <h3>Common Tools</h3>
                <ul class="muted bullets">
                    <li><strong>ping</strong> — ICMP reachability and RTT measurement.</li>

                    <li><strong>dig / nslookup</strong> — DNS resolution debugging.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example Debug Flow</h3>
                <ol class="muted bullets">
                    <li>Reproduce the issue and capture a timestamp.</li>

                    <h3>Q1 — Subnetting Puzzle (Easy)</h3>
                    <p class="muted">You have network 10.0.0.0/22. You need at least 4 subnets with equal sizes. What
                        CIDR prefix should you use for each subnet? List the first subnet ranges.</p>

                    <pre id="sol1" class="solution code"
                        style="display:none">/22 has 1024 addresses? Wait — that's wrong — calculate: /22 -> 2^(32-22)=2^10=1024 addresses. To split into 4 equal subnets, need /24 (2 extra bits): /24 -> 256 addresses. Subnets: 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24.</pre>

                <div class="qa">
                    <h3>Q2 — TCP Sequence / Retransmission (Medium)</h3>
                    <p class="muted">Client sends SYN (seq=100). Server replies SYN-ACK (seq=300, ack=101). Client sends
                        ACK (ack=301). Now client sends data with seq=101 length=1000 bytes. Server never ACKs (packet
                        loss). Explain what happens, and how TCP retransmission/backoff behaves.</p>
                    <button class="reveal" onclick="toggleReveal('sol2')">Reveal Solution</button>
                    <pre id="sol2" class="solution code"
                        style="display:none">Client will retransmit after RTO (retransmission timeout) based on RTT estimators (SRTT, RTTVAR). Each retransmission doubles RTO (exponential backoff) until a limit. If ACK arrives, congestion window reduces (multiplicative decrease) and slow-start or congestion avoidance applies. If repeated failures, connection may be reset.</pre>

                    <p class="muted">AS 65010 receives a prefix from two neighbors: path A via AS path [65020, 65030],
                        local_pref=100; path B via AS path [65040], local_pref=200. Which path is preferred and why?
                        What if AS_PATH is prepended on path B?</p>

                    <pre id="sol3" class="solution code"
                        style="display:none">BGP selects highest LOCAL_PREF first — path B (local_pref 200) is preferred regardless of AS_PATH length. If AS_PATH on B is prepended to be longer, LOCAL_PREF still wins. Only when LOCAL_PREFs equal does AS_PATH length get considered.</pre>

                    <h3>Q4 — Design: High-Availability Load Balancer (Design)</h3>
                    <p class="muted">Design a highly available global load balancing solution for a web app across two
                        regions with active-active deployment. Include health checks, session stickiness, and failover
                        considerations.</p>

                    <pre id="sol4" class="solution code"
                        style="display:none">Use DNS-based global load balancing with health-checked endpoints (low TTL). Use anycast or GeoDNS to route clients to nearest region. Each region has local LBs with active-active app servers. For stickiness, use cookie-based affinity stored in signed cookies or use centralized session store (Redis) replicated cross-region. Implement health checks and automated failover; use data replication (multi-master or active-passive DB plus conflict resolution). Consider consistency implications and failover drills.</pre>

                    <h3>Q5 — Practical: Why is traceroute showing an asterisk (*) at some hop?</h3>
                    <p class="muted">Explain the possible reasons and how you'd investigate.</p>
                    <button class="reveal" onclick="toggleReveal('sol5')">Reveal Solution</button>
                    <pre id="sol5" class="solution code"
                        style="display:none">Asterisk means no ICMP Time Exceeded reply from that hop — reasons: router rate-limits ICMP, firewall blocks TTL-expired messages, or the device is configured not to respond. Investigation: use TCP traceroute to port 80/443, check firewalls, run packet capture at source to see if ICMP replies arrive and are filtered locally, or try from another vantage point.</pre>
